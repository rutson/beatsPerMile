# beatsPerMile
Garmin Connect IQ data field to display heartbeats per mile (or kilometre - based on system setting).

I became curious about beats-per-mile following an interview with Steve Way[1] on Marathon Talk Episode 436[2].

An evening of pratting around with Connect IQ and thanks to a helpful tutorial[3], v0.1 of beatsPerMile was born.
